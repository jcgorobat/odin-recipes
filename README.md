# odin-recipes
Repository created for The Odin Project's web dev activity building my first, and very own recipe website.

This project is aimed to build my own (and very first) food recipe website. Currently, the goal of this project is to showcase my learnings in 
- setting-up git repositories and exploring git commands using BASH command line
- applying basic knowledge in Semantic HTML by using approriate tags, elements and its attributes
- pushing "git commits" as a healthy habit - following the seven rules of making a great Git commit message
- making a basic recipe website with working links.

Also, this project will serve as my "base project" and will be updated time-to-time. I will use this project to apply new learnings in CSS, JavaScript or any other frameworks which I will learn in the future.
